\opening{Dear Hiring Manager:}%

As a recent, September 2022 graduate with a Master's degree in Mathematics and a proven programmer, I am confident that I can bring my technical problem-solving skills and software development lifecycle methodology to your company. My research project required me to create a website to visualize and test the results, which can be found live at https://ahblay.pythonanywhere.com. I possess the ability to explain technical jargon in an easy-to-understand manner, experience using open-source Python libraries to automate steps in geospatial processing workflows, and familiarity with GIS and distributed processing environments. Additionally, I have a varied skillset and interdisciplinary ability to address and solve problems, analytical and algorithmic thinking, my passion for learning and knowledge, as well as GitHub, Jira, and ArcPy experience. 
My commitment to quickly learn and apply new technologies to solve difficult problems, think creatively, and communicate effectively provides a perfect fit for your team's geospatial applications. With my enthusiasm and drive, I am eager to assist in developing and maintaining software solutions as part of a cross-functional team, and to make an impact on your company.%
\closing{Sincerely,}%
